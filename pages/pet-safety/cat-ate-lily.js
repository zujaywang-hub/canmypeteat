  { q: "Which lilies are toxic to cats?", a: "The most dangerous are true lilies: Easter lilies, Tiger lilies, Asiatic lilies, Daylilies, Japanese show lilies, and Stargazer lilies. ALL parts are toxic — petals, leaves, pollen, and water from the vase." },
  { q: "Can lily pollen kill a cat?", a: "Yes. Even a small amount of pollen licked from fur or paws can cause fatal kidney failure. If your cat has lily pollen on them, wash it off immediately and call your vet." },
  { q: "How quickly do lily poisoning symptoms appear?", a: "Vomiting usually begins within 2-4 hours. Kidney failure symptoms develop within 24-72 hours. Without treatment within 18 hours, the damage is often irreversible." },
  { q: "Are peace lilies also dangerous?", a: "Peace lilies and calla lilies contain calcium oxalate crystals which cause mouth irritation and drooling, but they do NOT cause kidney failure like true lilies. They're less dangerous but still cause discomfort." },

      <ArticleBody quickAnswer="EXTREME EMERGENCY: Lilies are the single most toxic common household plant for cats. ALL parts — petals, leaves, pollen, stems, and even the water in the vase — can cause fatal kidney failure. Rush your cat to the vet IMMEDIATELY, even if symptoms haven't appeared yet." details="True lily poisoning is the leading cause of fatal plant poisoning in cats. The toxic compound (not yet fully identified) causes acute kidney tubular necrosis — the cells in the kidneys die and cannot regenerate. What makes lilies uniquely dangerous is how little is needed: a cat brushing against a lily and licking pollen off its fur, biting a single leaf, or drinking water from the vase can all be fatal. The treatment window is extremely narrow — veterinary intervention within 6-18 hours of exposure gives the best chance of survival. After 18-24 hours, kidney damage is often irreversible. Cats are the only common household pets affected this severely." symptoms="Phase 1 (0-12 hours): vomiting, loss of appetite, drooling, lethargy. Phase 2 (12-24 hours): temporary apparent improvement (dangerous — do not assume recovery). Phase 3 (24-72 hours): increased urination followed by no urination (kidney shutdown), dehydration, seizures, death." whatToDo="STEP 1: Go to the emergency vet NOW — do not wait. Time is everything. STEP 2: If possible, bring the plant or a photo for identification. STEP 3: If pollen is on your cat's fur, gently wipe it off to prevent further ingestion. STEP 4: Treatment includes IV fluids for 48-72 hours and kidney monitoring. STEP 5: The sooner treatment begins, the better the prognosis. After 18 hours, survival rates drop dramatically." safeAlternatives="Cat-safe flowers and plants include roses, sunflowers, orchids, spider plants, and Boston ferns. Always check the ASPCA toxic plant database before bringing plants home." faqs={faqs} />
