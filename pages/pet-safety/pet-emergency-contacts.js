  { q: "Does ASPCA Poison Control charge a fee?", a: "Yes — there is typically a $75 consultation fee, but this includes follow-up calls. It may be covered by some pet insurance plans." },
  { q: "When should I go to the emergency vet vs calling poison control?", a: "If your pet is having seizures, difficulty breathing, losing consciousness, or bleeding heavily — go to the emergency vet immediately. For suspected poisoning where the pet is still stable, call poison control first for guidance." },
  { q: "How do I find my nearest emergency vet?", a: "Search 'emergency veterinarian near me' on Google Maps, or call your regular vet — their voicemail often lists the nearest emergency clinic for after-hours emergencies." },
