  { q: "How much onion is dangerous for dogs?", a: "Ingestion of more than 0.5% of a dog's body weight in onion can cause toxicity. For a 20-pound dog, that's roughly 1.5 ounces. However, even small amounts over time can be harmful." },
  { q: "Is onion powder more dangerous than raw onion?", a: "Yes. Onion powder is more concentrated and therefore more toxic by volume. A small amount of onion powder in food can contain the equivalent toxicity of a much larger raw onion." },
  { q: "Do all onion types affect dogs equally?", a: "All alliums are toxic to dogs, including white, yellow, red, and green onions, as well as shallots, leeks, chives, and garlic. Garlic is actually about 5x more potent than onions." },

      <ArticleBody quickAnswer="Onions are toxic to dogs. All forms — raw, cooked, powdered, dehydrated — contain thiosulphate which destroys red blood cells, leading to hemolytic anemia. Contact your vet if your dog has consumed more than a small bite." details="Onion toxicity damages the hemoglobin in red blood cells, forming structures called Heinz bodies. The affected red blood cells are destroyed faster than the body can replace them, leading to anemia. This damage is cumulative — even small amounts eaten repeatedly over days can cause toxicity. All members of the allium family are toxic: onions, garlic, leeks, chives, shallots, and scallions. Cooked onions are just as dangerous as raw. Onion powder is especially risky because it's concentrated and commonly found in many prepared foods, sauces, soups, and baby food." symptoms="Early (1-3 days): vomiting, diarrhea, loss of appetite, abdominal pain. Developing (3-5 days): lethargy, weakness, pale or yellowish gums, rapid breathing, dark reddish-brown urine. Severe: collapse, rapid heart rate, kidney damage." whatToDo="STEP 1: Estimate how much onion was consumed. STEP 2: If more than a small bite, call your vet. STEP 3: For large amounts, your vet may induce vomiting if within 2 hours. STEP 4: Blood tests may be needed to check red blood cell count over the next few days. STEP 5: Note that symptoms may be delayed 3-5 days, so monitoring is important even if your dog seems fine initially." safeAlternatives="If you're cooking for your dog, use pet-safe seasonings like a small amount of turmeric or parsley. Never add onion, garlic, or allium seasonings to your dog's food." faqs={faqs} />
