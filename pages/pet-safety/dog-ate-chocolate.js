  { q: "How much chocolate is dangerous for dogs?", a: "It depends on the type. For a 20-pound dog: white chocolate requires very large amounts to be toxic, milk chocolate becomes dangerous at about 1 ounce per pound of body weight, and just 0.1 ounce per pound of dark chocolate or baking cocoa can be lethal." },
  { q: "Should I make my dog vomit after eating chocolate?", a: "Do NOT induce vomiting without vet guidance. If ingestion was within the past 2 hours and your vet recommends it, they may instruct you to use hydrogen peroxide. Never use salt or other home remedies." },
  { q: "How long does chocolate poisoning last in dogs?", a: "Theobromine has a half-life of about 17.5 hours in dogs. Symptoms typically appear within 6-12 hours and can last 24-72 hours. Severe cases may require hospitalization." },
  { q: "Can a dog survive chocolate poisoning?", a: "Yes, with prompt veterinary treatment, most dogs survive chocolate poisoning. The key is acting quickly. Call your vet or ASPCA Poison Control at (888) 426-4435 immediately." },

      <ArticleBody quickAnswer="ACT IMMEDIATELY: 1) Stay calm. 2) Note the type of chocolate, amount eaten, and your dog's weight. 3) Call your vet or ASPCA Poison Control at (888) 426-4435. 4) Do NOT induce vomiting unless instructed by a professional. Time is critical — theobromine toxicity can be fatal." details="Chocolate toxicity in dogs is caused by theobromine and caffeine. Dogs metabolize these compounds much slower than humans. The severity depends on three factors: the type of chocolate (darker = more dangerous), the amount consumed, and your dog's size. Toxicity levels per pound of dog weight: milk chocolate becomes concerning at 0.5 oz/lb, dark chocolate at 0.13 oz/lb, and baking chocolate/cocoa powder at just 0.1 oz/lb. White chocolate has very little theobromine but the high fat content can still cause pancreatitis. If you're unsure of the amount, always err on the side of caution and call your vet." symptoms="Early signs (2-4 hours): vomiting, diarrhea, restlessness, increased urination. Moderate (6-12 hours): hyperactivity, rapid heart rate, rapid breathing, excessive panting. Severe (12-36 hours): muscle tremors, seizures, heart failure, and potentially death." whatToDo="STEP 1: Check the chocolate type and estimate how much was eaten. STEP 2: Call your vet or ASPCA Poison Control at (888) 426-4435 immediately. STEP 3: Follow their instructions — they may recommend bringing your dog in for induced vomiting and activated charcoal treatment. STEP 4: Do NOT wait for symptoms to appear. Early treatment is far more effective. STEP 5: Keep remaining chocolate packaging to show the vet." safeAlternatives="If your dog loves the taste of chocolate, try carob-based dog treats — they look and taste similar to chocolate but contain no theobromine. Available at most pet stores." faqs={faqs} />
