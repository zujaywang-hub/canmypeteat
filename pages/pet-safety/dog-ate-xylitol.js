      <ArticleBody quickAnswer="LIFE-THREATENING EMERGENCY: Xylitol causes fatal hypoglycemia and liver failure in dogs. Call your vet or ASPCA Poison Control (888) 426-4435 IMMEDIATELY. Do not wait for symptoms — they can appear within 10 minutes and death can occur within hours." details="Xylitol is the most acutely dangerous common household substance for dogs. It triggers a massive insulin release, causing blood sugar to plummet to lethal levels within 10-60 minutes. Higher doses also cause acute liver necrosis within 12-48 hours. The toxic dose is just 0.1g/kg body weight for hypoglycemia and 0.5g/kg for liver failure. A 10-pound dog can be killed by a single piece of sugar-free gum. Common sources: sugar-free gum and mints, some peanut butter brands (ALWAYS check labels), sugar-free candy, baked goods, toothpaste, mouthwash, some medications and vitamins. Xylitol may also be listed as 'birch sugar' on labels." symptoms="RAPID ONSET (10-60 min): vomiting, weakness, loss of coordination, staggering, collapse, seizures. LIVER FAILURE (12-48 hrs): jaundice (yellow gums/eyes), bruising, bleeding, coma. Without treatment, death can occur within hours." whatToDo="STEP 1: Call your vet or ASPCA Poison Control (888) 426-4435 NOW. STEP 2: Note what product was consumed, approximate amount, and when. STEP 3: If directed, rush to emergency vet for treatment (IV dextrose, liver protectants). STEP 4: Do NOT induce vomiting unless specifically directed. STEP 5: Bring the product packaging to the vet. EVERY MINUTE COUNTS." safeAlternatives="Keep all xylitol products locked away from dogs. When buying peanut butter, choose brands that explicitly state 'no xylitol'. Regular sugar, while not healthy, is not acutely toxic to dogs like xylitol." faqs={faqs} />
