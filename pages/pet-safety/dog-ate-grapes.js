  { q: "How many grapes are toxic to a dog?", a: "There is no known safe amount. Even a single grape has caused kidney failure in some dogs. The toxic dose varies unpredictably between individual dogs, so treat ANY amount as an emergency." },
  { q: "My dog ate one grape 2 hours ago and seems fine. Should I still worry?", a: "YES. Symptoms of grape toxicity may not appear for 12-24 hours, and by then kidney damage may already be occurring. Contact your vet immediately regardless of whether symptoms are present." },
  { q: "Are raisins more dangerous than grapes?", a: "Yes, raisins are more concentrated and therefore more toxic by weight. A small handful of raisins can be more dangerous than several whole grapes." },
  { q: "What about grape juice or wine?", a: "Grape juice contains the same toxic compounds. Wine is doubly dangerous — both the grape toxins and the alcohol are harmful. Both should be treated as emergencies." },

      <ArticleBody quickAnswer="THIS IS AN EMERGENCY: Grapes and raisins can cause acute kidney failure in dogs, and there is no known safe amount. Call your vet or ASPCA Poison Control at (888) 426-4435 IMMEDIATELY, even if your dog seems fine." details="Grape and raisin toxicity in dogs was first identified in 2001, and researchers recently identified tartaric acid as the likely toxic compound. What makes grape toxicity particularly dangerous is its unpredictability — some dogs eat grapes with no apparent ill effects, while others develop fatal kidney failure from just one or two grapes. There is currently no way to predict which dogs are susceptible. Because of this unpredictability, ALL grape and raisin ingestion should be treated as a potential emergency. This includes fresh grapes, raisins, sultanas, currants, grape juice, and wine. Time is critical — treatment within the first few hours gives the best outcome." symptoms="Early (first 24 hours): vomiting, diarrhea, loss of appetite, lethargy, abdominal pain. Progressing (24-48 hours): decreased urination or no urination (sign of kidney shutdown), dehydration, excessive thirst, nausea. Severe (48-72 hours): complete kidney failure, seizures, coma." whatToDo="STEP 1: Call your vet or ASPCA Poison Control at (888) 426-4435 NOW. STEP 2: If instructed, your vet may induce vomiting (most effective within 2 hours of ingestion). STEP 3: Your dog will likely need IV fluids and kidney function monitoring for 48-72 hours. STEP 4: Do NOT wait for symptoms — kidney damage begins before symptoms appear. STEP 5: Note approximately how many grapes/raisins were consumed." safeAlternatives="Blueberries, watermelon (no seeds), apple slices (no seeds), and strawberries are safe fruit alternatives that dogs enjoy." faqs={faqs} />
