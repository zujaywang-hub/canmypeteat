  { q: "Can I feed my cat canned tuna meant for humans?", a: "Occasionally and in small amounts. Human canned tuna has higher sodium and often contains additives. Choose chunk light in water with no added salt if you must. Cat-specific tuna products are always better." },
  { q: "Why do cats love tuna so much?", a: "Cats are attracted to tuna's strong smell and high protein/fat content. The amino acid profile triggers their taste receptors intensely. Some cats can become 'tuna addicts' — this is a real concern as it can lead them to refuse other foods." },
  { q: "Can canned tuna cause mercury poisoning in cats?", a: "Yes, with regular feeding. Tuna accumulates mercury as a larger predatory fish. Cats are small and more susceptible to mercury effects. Symptoms include neurological issues, loss of coordination, and kidney damage." },

    <ArticleLayout title="Can Cats Eat Canned Tuna? With Caution — Mercury Risk | CanMyPetEat" description="Canned tuna is safe as an occasional treat but risky as regular food due to mercury, sodium, and nutritional imbalance." canonical="/can-cats-eat/tuna-canned" petType="cat" food="Canned Tuna" safety="caution">
      <ArticleBody quickAnswer="Occasionally only — a small amount of canned tuna as a rare treat is fine, but regular feeding is risky. Canned tuna contains mercury (which accumulates over time), high sodium, and lacks essential nutrients cats need (especially taurine and vitamin E in proper amounts). Some cats become addicted to tuna and refuse all other food, creating dangerous nutritional deficiencies." details="Canned tuna is probably the most iconic 'cat food' in popular culture, but veterinarians consistently warn against regular feeding. The concerns are: (1) Mercury — tuna is a large predatory fish that bioaccumulates mercury. Regular consumption can lead to mercury poisoning in cats, causing neurological problems and kidney damage. (2) Sodium — canned tuna for humans contains 200-400mg sodium per can, far too much for cats. (3) Nutritional imbalance — tuna alone doesn't provide complete nutrition. It lacks sufficient taurine (essential for cat heart and eye health), vitamin E, and has an improper calcium-to-phosphorus ratio. (4) Tuna addiction — the strong flavor can cause cats to become fixated on tuna and refuse nutritionally complete cat food. (5) Thiaminase — raw tuna contains an enzyme that destroys thiamine (vitamin B1), though canning reduces this. Choose chunk light tuna in water over albacore (less mercury) and always choose no-salt-added varieties." symptoms="Mercury accumulation over time: loss of coordination, wobbling, neurological changes, vision problems, kidney damage" whatToDo="If offering as a treat: use chunk light tuna in water (lower mercury than albacore). Drain well. Give no more than 1 tablespoon, no more than once a week. Never make it a dietary staple. Cat-specific tuna products are formulated better than human canned tuna." safeAlternatives="Better fish options for cats: canned sardines in water (lower mercury, more omega-3s), cooked salmon, cooked cod, or commercial cat food with tuna as an ingredient (properly formulated with all essential nutrients)." faqs={faqs} />
