      <ArticleBody quickAnswer="Yes, technically safe — plain cooked corn kernels won't poison your cat, but corn offers very little nutritional value for felines. Cats are obligate carnivores and cannot efficiently digest or utilize carbohydrates from corn. It's also a common allergen in cats. A few kernels won't hurt, but don't make it a regular treat." details="Corn is not toxic to cats, but it's essentially empty calories for them. Cats lack the digestive enzymes to efficiently break down and utilize plant-based carbohydrates. Corn is often used as a cheap filler in lower-quality cat foods, contributing to the carbohydrate load without providing meaningful nutrition for carnivores. Some cats are allergic to corn, showing symptoms like itchy skin, ear infections, or digestive issues. Corn on the cob is particularly dangerous — the cob can cause intestinal obstruction if swallowed. Canned corn contains added salt. Creamed corn has dairy and sugar. Butter corn has excess fat. Only plain, cooked kernels are acceptable." symptoms="In allergic cats: itching, skin irritation, ear infections, vomiting, diarrhea" whatToDo="If sharing corn, only offer a few plain cooked kernels. Remove from the cob. No butter, salt, or seasonings. Watch for signs of allergic reaction if it's your cat's first time." safeAlternatives="Better treat options for cats: plain cooked chicken, freeze-dried meat treats, small pieces of cooked fish, or pumpkin (which actually benefits feline digestion unlike corn)." faqs={faqs} />
