  { q: "Has Blue Buffalo had recalls?", a: "Yes — Blue Buffalo has had several recalls over the years, including for elevated moisture and potential salmonella contamination. They also settled a lawsuit about mislabeling by-product ingredients. Quality has improved but the history is worth noting." },
  { q: "Is Blue Buffalo good for cats?", a: "Blue Buffalo's Wilderness line is a solid choice for cats — grain-free, high protein, and real meat first. The regular Life Protection line is decent but contains some grains. Avoid the Basics line for cats as it uses limited ingredients." },
  { q: "Blue Buffalo vs Orijen?", a: "Orijen is significantly higher quality (75-85% meat vs Blue Buffalo's ~35-40%). But Orijen costs 2-3x more. Blue Buffalo is a good mid-to-upper tier choice if Orijen is out of budget." },

    <ArticleLayout title="Blue Buffalo Pet Food Review — Ingredient Analysis | CanMyPetEat" description="Detailed ingredient analysis of Blue Buffalo pet food. Rating: A-. Premium brand with natural ingredients and no by-products." canonical="/brand-review/blue-buffalo" petType="dog" food="Blue Buffalo (Brand)" safety="safe">
      <ArticleBody quickAnswer="Overall Rating: A- — Blue Buffalo is a reputable premium brand that uses real meat as the first ingredient and avoids by-products, corn, wheat, and soy. Their LifeSource Bits contain a blend of antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals. One of the better widely-available options in pet stores." details="PROS: Real meat is always the first ingredient. No poultry by-product meals. No corn, wheat, or soy. No artificial colors, flavors, or preservatives. LifeSource Bits add targeted nutrition (antioxidants, vitamins). Wide range of formulas (Wilderness grain-free, Life Protection, Basics limited ingredient). Widely available in most pet stores and online. CONS: Has had multiple recalls in the past. Settled a class-action lawsuit over mislabeled ingredients (by-products found despite claims). More expensive than mainstream brands but less premium than Orijen/ACANA. Some formulas still use peas and legumes as major ingredients. Meat content is moderate (~35-40%), not as high as ultra-premium brands. TYPICAL INGREDIENTS (Wilderness): Deboned chicken, chicken meal, peas, pea protein, tapioca starch — real chicken leads but plant-based fillers appear early." symptoms="" whatToDo="Blue Buffalo is a solid everyday choice. Transition gradually over 7-10 days. The Wilderness line is their best for quality ingredients. For cats, Wilderness Indoor or the regular Wilderness formula are good picks. For dogs with allergies, the Basics limited ingredient line may help." safeAlternatives="Similar quality: Wellness CORE, Merrick, Taste of the Wild. Higher quality: Orijen (A), ACANA (A-). Budget-friendly alternatives: Diamond Naturals, Whole Earth Farms." faqs={faqs} />
