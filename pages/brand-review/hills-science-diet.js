  { q: "Why do vets always recommend Hill's?", a: "Hill's invests heavily in veterinary education and research. Their prescription diets are clinically tested and effective for specific conditions. Vets recommend what they've seen work clinically. However, their regular Science Diet line is decent but not exceptional." },
  { q: "Is Hill's Prescription Diet worth the cost?", a: "For pets with specific medical conditions (kidney disease, urinary issues, food allergies), yes — Hill's prescription diets are among the best clinically formulated foods available. For healthy pets, their regular line is fine but not necessarily better than other premium brands." },
  { q: "Has Hill's had recalls?", a: "Yes — in 2019, Hill's had a significant recall for excessive vitamin D levels in canned dog food, which caused illness and some deaths. They've since improved quality control measures." },

    <ArticleLayout title="Hill's Science Diet Review — Ingredient Analysis | CanMyPetEat" description="Detailed ingredient analysis of Hill's Science Diet pet food. Rating: B+. Science-backed nutrition trusted by veterinarians." canonical="/brand-review/hills-science-diet" petType="dog" food="Hill's Science Diet (Brand)" safety="safe">
      <ArticleBody quickAnswer="Overall Rating: B+ — Hill's is a science-based pet food brand with strong veterinary backing. Their Prescription Diet line is highly regarded for managing specific health conditions. The regular Science Diet line is solid but uses some fillers. Ingredient transparency is good. A reliable choice, especially for pets with health issues." details="PROS: Backed by extensive clinical research. Prescription Diet line is excellent for specific health conditions (kidney, urinary, digestive, weight). Real meat is typically the first ingredient. No artificial colors, flavors, or preservatives in most formulas. Trusted by veterinarians worldwide. Consistent quality with good manufacturing standards. Wide availability. CONS: Regular Science Diet uses corn, wheat gluten, and some filler ingredients. Meat content is moderate compared to ultra-premium brands. Premium price for ingredients that aren't as premium as Orijen/ACANA. The 2019 vitamin D recall was a significant quality control failure. Some formulas use by-product meal. Heavy investment in vet marketing may influence recommendations. TYPICAL INGREDIENTS (Adult): Chicken, whole grain wheat, cracked pearled barley, whole grain corn, chicken meal — real chicken first but grains feature prominently." symptoms="" whatToDo="Hill's Science Diet is a good everyday food for most pets. If your vet recommends a Hill's Prescription Diet for a specific condition, follow their guidance. Transition over 7-10 days. For healthy pets wanting better ingredients, consider their Ideal Balance or Perfect Digestion lines." safeAlternatives="Similar quality: Royal Canin (B, strong prescription line), Purina Pro Plan (B+). Higher quality: Blue Buffalo (A-), ACANA (A-), Orijen (A). Budget alternative: IAMS (B)." faqs={faqs} />
