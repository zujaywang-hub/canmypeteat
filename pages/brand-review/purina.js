  { q: "Which Purina line is best?", a: "Pro Plan is their best line — real meat first, good protein content, and backed by research. Beyond is decent (natural ingredients). ONE is mid-range. Dog Chow/Cat Chow are budget lines with more fillers." },
  { q: "Is Purina Pro Plan good for dogs?", a: "Yes — Pro Plan is a solid choice. It uses real meat as the first ingredient, has sport and specialized formulas, and is used by many breeders and working dog handlers. It's significantly better than their budget lines." },
  { q: "Does Purina use artificial colors?", a: "Some Purina products (especially Friskies and lower-end lines) contain artificial colors like Red 40, Yellow 5, and Blue 2. Pro Plan and Beyond lines generally avoid artificial colors." },

    <ArticleLayout title="Purina Pet Food Review — Ingredient Analysis | CanMyPetEat" description="Detailed ingredient analysis of Purina pet food. Rating: B-. Wide range from budget to premium with varying quality." canonical="/brand-review/purina" petType="dog" food="Purina (Brand)" safety="caution">
      <ArticleBody quickAnswer="Overall Rating: B- — Purina (owned by Nestlé) offers an enormous range of pet food from budget to premium. Pro Plan is their best line (B+ on its own). Their mid-range lines (ONE, Beyond) are decent. Budget lines (Dog Chow, Cat Chow, Friskies) use more fillers and artificial ingredients. Quality varies dramatically by product line." details="PROS: Pro Plan line is well-researched and solid quality. Extremely wide availability everywhere. Price points for every budget. Pro Plan Sport is popular with active/working dogs. Some specialized formulas for specific needs. Extensive research facilities and feeding trials. CONS: Budget lines (Dog Chow, Cat Chow) are heavy on corn and by-products. Some products contain artificial colors (Red 40, Yellow 5, Blue 2). Corn gluten meal used as a protein source in cheaper lines. Quality gap between Pro Plan and budget lines is enormous. Friskies and similar budget lines have very low meat content. Corporate ownership (Nestlé) raises ethical concerns for some consumers. TYPICAL INGREDIENTS (Pro Plan): Chicken, rice, corn gluten meal, whole grain wheat, poultry by-product meal. TYPICAL INGREDIENTS (Dog Chow): Whole grain corn, meat and bone meal, corn gluten meal, animal fat — corn dominates." symptoms="" whatToDo="If choosing Purina, go with Pro Plan for the best quality. Pro Plan Savor and Sport lines are solid options. Avoid the budget lines (Dog Chow, Cat Chow) if possible — the ingredient quality is significantly lower. For cats, Pro Plan is acceptable but cat-specific premium brands may be better." safeAlternatives="Similar to Pro Plan: Hill's Science Diet (B+), IAMS ProActive (B). Better quality: Blue Buffalo (A-), ACANA (A-). Budget alternative with better ingredients: Diamond Naturals." faqs={faqs} />
