  { q: "Can dogs eat raw chicken?", a: "Most vets recommend against it due to Salmonella and Campylobacter risks. While some raw-feeding advocates disagree, the bacterial contamination risk is real. Cooking eliminates this risk entirely." },
  { q: "Can dogs eat chicken bones?", a: "NEVER give cooked chicken bones — they splinter and can puncture the digestive tract. Raw bones are debatable (softer, less likely to splinter) but still carry risk. See our dedicated article on chicken bones for dogs." },
  { q: "Can dogs eat chicken skin?", a: "Not recommended. Chicken skin is very high in fat and can trigger pancreatitis, especially in smaller dogs or breeds prone to the condition. Remove skin before serving." },

      <ArticleBody quickAnswer="Yes — plain cooked chicken is one of the best foods you can give your dog! It's lean, high-quality protein that's easy to digest. Many premium dog foods use chicken as their primary ingredient. Serve boneless, skinless, and without any seasoning. Vets often recommend plain boiled chicken for dogs with upset stomachs." details="Chicken is an excellent protein source for dogs. It provides essential amino acids, B vitamins (especially niacin and B6), phosphorus, and selenium. Plain boiled or baked chicken breast is the healthiest preparation — lean, easy to digest, and gentle on the stomach. It's the go-to bland diet food recommended by vets for dogs recovering from GI issues, usually paired with plain white rice. Chicken is also commonly used to entice picky eaters or dogs recovering from illness. Most dogs absolutely love the taste. However, some dogs can develop chicken allergies — symptoms include itchy skin, ear infections, and digestive issues. If you suspect a chicken allergy, consult your vet about novel protein alternatives. Always remove bones (cooked bones splinter dangerously), skin (too fatty), and never use seasoned, fried, or heavily processed chicken." whatToDo="Boil or bake chicken breast until fully cooked (165°F/74°C internal temperature). Let cool, then shred or dice into appropriate-sized pieces for your dog. Remove all bones and skin. Serve plain — no salt, garlic, onion, or seasonings." safeAlternatives="Other excellent protein sources: plain cooked turkey, cooked lean beef, cooked salmon (omega-3 benefits), cooked duck, and cooked eggs. For dogs with chicken allergies: venison, rabbit, or fish-based proteins." faqs={faqs} />
